  <h1>Udacity Nanodegree Notes<br>Intro to Programming</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Thinking like a programmer</h3>

Procedural thinking - taking a big problem and breaking it down the solution into a set of steps<br>

<ul>
<li>Abstract thinking - 1+1=2<br>
<li>Systematic debugging - systemic way of solving problems<br>
<li>Technological empathy - thinking the way a computer does - looking at code and imagining what it looks like in a webpage, and looking at a webpage and seeing code
<li>Systems thinking - taking one big idea and breaking it down into component parts (other 4 mentioned, above)
</ul>

<h3>Summary of 1st Course</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lesson one: The basics of the web and HTML - see HTML as a webpage
<li>Lesson two: Creating a structured doc with HTML - look at web page and predict what HTML will look like
<li>Lesson three: Adding style to structure with CSS
</ul>

<h2>Lesson one: Basics of the web and HTML</h2>

<h3>The Web</h3>

<ul>
<li>Invented 1990’s - now has 30 billion webpages, it's basically a collection of HTML documents
<li>HTML = Hypertext markup language: HTML language is what glues everything together on the web - text, videos, images
<li>The links between webpages is what makes the web “weblike”
</ul>

<h3>Major Pieces of the web</h3>

The web is basically made up of three components: You, your computer and your browser; the internet, and servers.<br>

<ul>
<li>The browser makes requests via the internet to servers with a protocol called HTTP
<li>The server responds with files that your browser displays - browsers include IE, Chrome, Firefox
<li>Servers are computers just like yours, but are optimized for hosting files instead of browsing
</ul>

<h3>HTML</h3>

A. HTML docs are the heart of the web and are made up of:

<ul>
<li>Text content - what you see
<li>Mark up - what it looks like or how it is arranged (not seen)
<li>References to other docs (images, videos)
<li>Links to other pages
</ul>

B. HTML markup
<br>
<br>
HTML markup is made up of tags, which are constructed like this: 

&lt;opening tag&gt;content&lt;/closing tag&gt;
<br>
<br>
Examples:

<ul>
<li>&lt;b&gt; tag - makes content bold
<li>&lt;em&gt; tag - means emphasis - makes content italicized
<li>&lt;a&gt; tag - anchor tag - this is for making links
</ul>

C. HTML attribute tags
<br>
<br>
An HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element. They are usually added to a HTML start tag, which along with content and end tag comprises most HTML elements. Particular attributes are only supported by particular element types; if they are added to elements that do not support them they will not function (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute">HTML attribute</a> Wiki page).
<br>
<br>
For example:
<br>
<br>
&lt;tag ATTR = “value”&gt;contents&lt;/tag&gt;
<br>
<br>
Examples:

<ul>
<li>&lt;a href = “www.reddit.com”&gt;derp &lt;/a&gt; = derp
<li>&lt;a href = “www.w3c.com”&gt; HTML &lt;/a&gt; = HTML
<li>&lt;a href = “www.udacity.com”&gt;my favorite &lt;/a&gt; = my favorite
</ul>

D. Image tag
<br>
<br>
&lt;img&gt; is used to download images. For example:

<ul>
<li>&lt;img src = “url” alt = “text”&gt;
</ul>

“url” is for the image to download<br>
“text” is for broken requests - the text that is displayed if image does not load

<ul>
<li>&lt;img src = “http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png” alt&gt; = “hipmunk!”
</ul>

The image tag does not have or need a closing tag - it’s a “void tag” - has no content
<br>
<br>
E. Whitespace
<br>
<br>
When you enter text in multiple lines, in HTML it renders it in single space

&lt;br&gt; is to create a space break. This is another example of a void tag.

<ul>
<li>To make double spaces you can use either a &lt;br&gt; or a &lt;p&gt; tag.
<li>To use &lt;br&gt; as a double space, you just use two in a row: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
</ul>

&lt;p&gt; is a “block text” - you need a closing tag: &lt;p&gt; narrative &lt;/p&gt;
<br>
<br>
Difference between "br" and "p":

<ul>
<li>"br" is an “inline element” - just ends a line 
<li>"p" narrative is a “block element” - it makes an invisible box to put narrative. The box has width and height.
</ul>

F. Span/Div Elements
<br>
<br>
The "Span" and "Div" tags just contain their content:

<ul>
<li>Span is inline and is written like this: &lt;div&gt; text &lt;/div&gt;<br>
<li>Div is block and is written like this: &lt;span&gt; text &lt;/span&gt;
</ul>

You can add attributes called “class” to Span/Div elements:

<ul>
<li>&lt;div class = “foo”&gt; text &lt;/div&gt;
<li>&lt;span class = “bar”&gt; text &lt;/span&gt;
</ul>

G. Structure of HTML Document
<br>
<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; - doctype<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>

</body>
